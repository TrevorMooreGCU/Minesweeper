# Minesweeper
My Minesweeper .NET MVC web app. I coded it front to back, top to bottom, and made my own minesweeper game logic that works as the game engine.

# Inspiration
I wanted to incorporate my back-end minesweeper game logic API into a hosted web app.

# What it does
You can create an account, login, play, and save your minesweeper games. You can also use my highscores API to get see everyone's highscores, or feel free to use it in your own app if you're into that.

# How I built it
I used .NET MVC, C#, CSS, HTML, Razor, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax
